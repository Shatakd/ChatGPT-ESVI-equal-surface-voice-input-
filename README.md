Equal-Surface Voice Input (ESVI) is a product case study exploring how UI design and interaction patterns can significantly increase voice input adoption on ChatGPT mobile by giving voice and text equal visual priority.
Project Description
🎙️ Equal-Surface Voice Input (ESVI)

Equal-Surface Voice Input (ESVI) is a product case study focused on improving voice input adoption on ChatGPT mobile, especially in mobile-first markets like India.

While voice input exists, adoption remains low. This project demonstrates that the core issue is not speech recognition accuracy, but discoverability, trust, and habit formation driven by UI design.

ESVI reimagines the chat composer by giving voice and text equal visual prominence through a dual-capsule input design, supported by live transcription and edit-before-send flows. The goal is to remove friction, build confidence, and make voice a natural, repeatable interaction.
